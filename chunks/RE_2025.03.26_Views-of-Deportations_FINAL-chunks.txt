**2. Personal impacts of deportations and arrests on U.S. adults**

This chapter explores whether U.S. adults worry about being asked to prove their U.S. citizenship or immigration status during their daily routine and if they believe deportations of immigrants living in the United States illegally will make their lives better or worse.

**Do people worry they or someone close to them might be deported?**

About one-in-five U.S. adults (19%) say they worry a lot or some that they, a family member or a friend could be deported.

**By nativity**

*   One-in-three immigrants in the country worry they or someone close to them could be deported.
*   By comparison, 16% of U.S.-born adults share this worry.

**By race and ethnicity**

*   42% of Latinos say they worry they or someone close to them might be deported.3

Methodology
The American Trends Panel survey methodology

Overview
Data in this report comes from Wave 164 of the American Trends Panel (ATP), Pew Research Center's nationally representative panel of randomly selected U.S. adults. The survey was conducted from Feb. 24 to March 2, 2025. A total of 5,123 panelists responded out of 5,737 who were sampled, for a survey-level response rate of 89%.

The cumulative response rate accounting for nonresponse to the recruitment surveys and attrition is 3%. The break-off rate among panelists who logged on to the survey and completed at least one item is 1%. The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 5,123 respondents is plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.

The survey includes an oversample of non-Hispanic Asian adults in order to provide more precise estimates of the opinions and experiences of these smaller demographic subgroups. These oversampled groups are weighted back to reflect their correct proportions in the population.

SSRS conducted the survey for Pew Research Center via online (n=4,939) and live telephone (n=184) interviewing. Interviews were conducted in both English and Spanish.

--- Chunk 29 ---
To learn more about the ATP, read "About the American Trends Panel."

Panel recruitment
Since 2018, the ATP has used address-based sampling (ABS) for recruitment. A study cover letter and a pre-incentive are mailed to a stratified, random sample of households selected from the U.S. Postal Service's Computerized Delivery Sequence File. This Postal Service file has been estimated to cover 90% to 98% of the population.4 Within each sampled household, the adult with the next birthday is selected to participate. Other details of the ABS recruitment protocol have changed over time but are available upon request.5 Prior to 2018, the ATP was recruited using landline and cellphone random-digit-dial surveys administered in English and Spanish.

A national sample of U.S. adults has been recruited to the ATP approximately once per year since 2014. In some years, the recruitment has included additional efforts (known as an “oversample")

to improve the accuracy of data for underrepresented groups. For example, Hispanic adults, Black
adults and Asian adults were oversampled in 2019, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

Sample design
The overall target population for this survey was noninstitutionalized persons ages 18 and older
living in the United States. It featured a stratified random sample from the ATP in which non-
Hispanic Asian adults were selected with certainty. The remaining panelists were sampled at rates
designed to ensure that the share of respondents in each stratum is proportional to its share of the
U.S. adult population to the greatest extent possible. Respondent weights are adjusted to account
for differential probabilities of selection as described in the Weighting section below.

Questionnaire development and testing
The questionnaire was developed by Pew Research Center in consultation with SSRS. The web
program used for online respondents was rigorously tested on both PC and mobile devices by the
SSRS project team and Pew Research Center researchers. The SSRS project team also populated
test data that was analyzed in SPSS to ensure the logic and randomizations were working as
intended before launching the survey.

--- Chunk 31 ---
Incentives
All respondents were offered a post-paid incentive for their participation. Respondents could
choose to receive the post-paid incentive in the form of a check or gift code to Amazon.com,
Target.com or Walmart.com. Incentive amounts ranged from $5 to $20 depending on whether the
respondent belongs to a part of the population that is harder or easier to reach. Differential
incentive amounts were designed to increase panel survey participation among groups that
traditionally have low survey response propensities.

Data collection protocol
The data collection field period for this survey was Feb. 24 to March 2, 2025. Surveys were
conducted via self-administered web survey or by live telephone interviewing.

For panelists who take surveys online:6 Postcard notifications were mailed to a subset on
Feb. 24.7 Survey invitations were sent out in two separate launches: soft launch and full launch.
Sixty panelists were included in the soft launch, which began with an initial invitation sent on Feb.

6 The ATP does not use routers or chains in any part of its online data collection protocol, nor are they used to direct respondents to additional
surveys.
7 Postcard notifications for web panelists are sent to 1) panelists who were recruited within the last two years and 2) panelists recruited prior
to the last two years who opt to continue receiving postcard notifications.

| Final reminder    | March 1, 2025  | March 1, 2025  |

Panelists participating online were sent an email invitation and up to two email reminders if they did not respond to the survey. ATP panelists who consented to SMS messages were sent an SMS invitation with a link to the survey and up to two SMS reminders.

For panelists who take surveys over the phone with a live interviewer: Prenotification postcards were mailed on Feb. 21, 2025. Soft launch took place on Feb. 24, 2025, and involved dialing until a total of three interviews had been completed. All remaining English- and Spanish-speaking sampled phone panelists' numbers were dialed throughout the remaining field period. Panelists who take surveys via phone can receive up to six calls from trained SSRS interviewers.

Data quality checks

--- Chunk 33 ---
Data quality checks

To ensure high-quality data, Center researchers performed data quality checks to identify any respondents showing patterns of satisficing. This includes checking for whether respondents left questions blank at very high rates or always selected the first or last answer presented. As a result of this checking, two ATP respondents were removed from the survey dataset prior to weighting and analysis.

Weighting

The ATP data is weighted in a process that accounts for multiple stages of sampling and nonresponse that occur at different points in the panel survey process. First, each panelist begins with a base weight that reflects their probability of recruitment into the panel. These weights are then calibrated to align with the population benchmarks in the accompanying table to correct for nonresponse to recruitment surveys and panel attrition. If only a subsample of panelists was invited to participate in the wave, this weight is adjusted to account for any differential probabilities of selection.

Among the panelists who completed the survey, this weight is then calibrated again to align with the population benchmarks identified in the accompanying table and trimmed at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the loss in precision stemming from variance in the weights. Sampling errors and tests of statistical significance take into account the effect of weighting.

How we did this

Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand the American public's views of immigration enforcement policies and the personal impact they have on U.S. adults.

For this analysis, we surveyed 5,123 adults from Feb. 24 to March 2, 2025. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP's methodology.

Here are the questions used for this report, the topline and the survey methodology.

2025 PEW RESEARCH CENTER'S AMERICAN TRENDS PANEL
WAVE 164 March 2025
FINAL TOPLINE
FEBRUARY 24 – MARCH 2, 2025
TOTAL N=5,123

Note: All numbers are percentages unless otherwise noted. Percentages less than 0.5% are replaced by an asterisk (*). Rows/columns may not total 100% due to rounding. The questions presented below are part of a larger survey conducted on the American Trends Panel.

--- Chunk 42 ---
"No answer" includes web respondents who do not answer the question as well as telephone respondents who refuse to answer or who say they don't know how to answer. In cases where "not sure" was offered as an explicit option to web and telephone respondents, the "no answer" category includes only web skips and telephone refusals.

This survey was conducted primarily online, with some interviews conducted by live telephone. This topline shows the programming language for online administration. For details on how questions were slightly modified for phone administration, visit the questionnaire.

American Trends Panel surveys conducted between October 2016 and June 2024 were conducted fully online (with tablets and data plans provided to adults without home internet).

**Americans' Views of Deportations**

Most say arrests of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be allowed at protests or in homes, but not at places of worship or schools

As the new Trump administration begins to carry out immigration enforcement, Americans largely agree that at least some immigrants living in the United States illegally should be deported, in particular those who have committed violent crimes. However, less consensus exists on how the government should carry out deportations.

**About a third of U.S. adults say all immigrants in the U.S. illegally should be deported; half say some**

% who say immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should be deported

|       | All  | Some | None |
| :---- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Total | 32   | 51   | 16   |

Roughly one-third of U.S. adults (32%) say all immigrants living in the country illegally should be deported, while 16% say none should be deported. About half (51%) say at least some should face deportation.

U.S. adults who say some immigrants living in the country illegally should be deported have varying views of who should be removed. Nearly all (97%) support deporting those who have committed violent crimes.

--- Chunk 61 ---
Those who favor some deportations are more evenly divided when it comes to deporting those who have committed nonviolent crimes (52%) or have arrived in the U.S. during the past four years (44%). By contrast, far fewer say those with family ties in the U.S. should be deported,

**Nearly all who favor deporting ‘some’ immigrants living in the country illegally say that committing violent crime is grounds for deportation**

Among those who support some deportations, % who say immigrants in the U.S. illegally should be deported if they...

*   Committed violent crimes: 97%
*   Committed nonviolent crimes: 52%
*   Arrived in the country in the last four years: 44%
*   Have a job: 15%
*   Are parents of children born in the U.S.: 14%
*   Came to the U.S. as children: 9%
*   Are married to a U.S. citizen: 5%

Donald Trump signed *several executive orders* related to immigration after becoming president on
Jan. 20. By the end of February, apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border had dropped to
*historically low levels*, while *deportations trailed* those of the Biden administration.

In March, after the survey was conducted, *Trump used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798* to deport
*hundreds of immigrants* that his administration said were gang members living in the country
illegally. The rarely used act allows the government, if at war, to deport immigrants without
allowing them to go before a judge.

During the pandemic, migration to the U.S. stalled because governments around the world
restricted travel. Since 2021, U.S. Border Patrol has recorded millions of encounters with migrants

--- Chunk 64 ---
crossing into the U.S. from Mexico without authorization, with many seeking asylum. These
encounters peaked in 2023 and dropped sharply in 2024.1

As of 2022, an estimated 11 million immigrants lived in the U.S. without authorization. This group
includes those who do not have a green card or other lawful temporary residence visa or are not
naturalized U.S. citizens.² It also includes an estimated 1.2 million immigrants enrolled in
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) who are
temporarily protected from deportation and have a permit to work.

About 772,000 immigrants have received temporary protection through parole programs for
Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans (CHNV) and Ukrainians since 2022. However,
the president can revoke these temporary protections. In late March, the Trump administration
announced it will remove this deportation protection for the approximately 532,000 CHNV
parolees.

Personal impact of deportations, immigration enforcement
Some U.S. adults express concern that they will be personally affected by the government's
immigration enforcement.

Personal impact of deportations, immigration enforcement
Some U.S. adults express concern that they will be personally affected by the government's
immigration enforcement.

*   About one-in-five U.S. adults (19%) say they worry a lot or somewhat that they, a family
    member or close friend could be deported.
*   And 5% of adults say they are extremely or very worried they will be asked to prove their
    U.S. citizenship or immigration status during their regular day-to-day activities, while
    8% say they are somewhat worried.
*   Notably, 42% of Hispanic adults say they are worried that they or someone close to them might
    be deported.
*   And 30% of immigrants say they worry that they might be asked for proof of their U.S.
    citizenship or immigration status.

--- Chunk 66 ---
¹ Encounters refer to events, not people, and some migrants are encountered more than once.
² The unauthorized immigrant population includes any immigrants not in the following groups: immigrants admitted for lawful residence (i.e.,
green card admissions); people admitted formally as refugees; people granted asylum; former unauthorized immigrants granted legal
residence under the 1985 Immigration Reform and Control Act; immigrants admitted in the previously mentioned categories who have
become naturalized U.S. citizens; and individuals admitted as lawful temporary residents under specific visa categories such as foreign
students, guest workers, and intracompany transfers. Read the methodology section of our November 2018 report on unauthorized
immigrants for more details. Pew Research Center's estimate of unauthorized immigrants as of July 2022 includes more than 3 million
immigrants who have temporary protection from deportation and permission to be in the U.S. Some also have permission to work in the
country. While these immigrants have permission to be in the U.S., they could be subject to deportation if government policy changes. In total,
they account for 30% of the national estimate of 11.0 million unauthorized immigrants for 2022.

Fewer adults also say that in the month prior to taking the survey, they made changes to their day-to-day lives due to worry over being questioned about their U.S. citizenship or immigration status.

*   2% say they **made changes in their daily schedule or routine** due to worrying they might be asked to prove their U.S. citizenship or immigration status.
