The survey was conducted from Feb. 24 to March 2, 2025. A total of 5,123 panelists responded out of 5,737 who were sampled, for a survey-level response rate of 89%.\n\nThe cumulative response rate accounting for nonresponse to the recruitment surveys and attrition is 3%. The break-off rate among panelists who logged on to the survey and completed at least one item is 1%. The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 5,123 respondents is plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.\n\nThe survey includes an oversample of non-Hispanic Asian adults in order to provide more precise estimates of the opinions and experiences of these smaller demographic subgroups. These oversampled groups are weighted back to reflect their correct proportions in the population.\n\nSSRS conducted the survey for Pew Research Center via online (n=4,939) and live telephone (n=184) interviewing. Interviews were conducted in both English and Spanish.\n\nTo learn more about the ATP, read \"About the American Trends Panel.\"",
  "To learn more about the ATP, read \"About the American Trends Panel.\"\n\nPanel recruitment\nSince 2018, the ATP has used address-based sampling (ABS) for recruitment. A study cover letter and a pre-incentive are mailed to a stratified, random sample of households selected from the U.S. Postal Service's Computerized Delivery Sequence File. This Postal Service file has been estimated to cover 90% to 98% of the population.4 Within each sampled household, the adult with the next birthday is selected to participate. Other details of the ABS recruitment protocol have changed over time but are available upon request.5 Prior to 2018, the ATP was recruited using landline and cellphone random-digit-dial surveys administered in English and Spanish.\n\nA national sample of U.S. adults has been recruited to the ATP approximately once per year since 2014. In some years, the recruitment has included additional efforts (known as an â€œoversample\")\n\n4 AAPOR Task Force on Address-based Sampling. 2016. \"AAPOR Report: Address-based Sampling.\"\n5 Email pewsurveys@pewresearch.org.\n\nwww.pewresearch.org\n\n\n--- Page: RE_2025.03.26_Views-of-Deportations_FINAL_page25.png ---\n```text\n25\nPEW RESEARCH CENTER\n\nto improve the accuracy of data for underrepresented groups.

For example, Hispanic adults, Black\nadults and Asian adults were oversampled in 2019, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\nSample design\nThe overall target population for this survey was noninstitutionalized persons ages 18 and older\nliving in the United States. It featured a stratified random sample from the ATP in which non-\nHispanic Asian adults were selected with certainty. The remaining panelists were sampled at rates\ndesigned to ensure that the share of respondents in each stratum is proportional to its share of the\nU.S. adult population to the greatest extent possible. Respondent weights are adjusted to account\nfor differential probabilities of selection as described in the Weighting section below.\n\nQuestionnaire development and testing\nThe questionnaire was developed by Pew Research Center in consultation with SSRS. The web\nprogram used for online respondents was rigorously tested on both PC and mobile devices by the\nSSRS project team and Pew Research Center researchers. The SSRS project team also populated\ntest data that was analyzed in SPSS to ensure the logic and randomizations were working as\nintended before launching the survey.",
  "Incentives\nAll respondents were offered a post-paid incentive for their participation. Respondents could\nchoose to receive the post-paid incentive in the form of a check or gift code to Amazon.com,\nTarget.com or Walmart.com. Incentive amounts ranged from $5 to $20 depending on whether the\nrespondent belongs to a part of the population that is harder or easier to reach. Differential\nincentive amounts were designed to increase panel survey participation among groups that\ntraditionally have low survey response propensities.\n\nData collection protocol\nThe data collection field period for this survey was Feb. 24 to March 2, 2025. Surveys were\nconducted via self-administered web survey or by live telephone interviewing.\n\nFor panelists who take surveys online:6 Postcard notifications were mailed to a subset on\nFeb. 24.7 Survey invitations were sent out in two separate launches: soft launch and full launch.\nSixty panelists were included in the soft launch, which began with an initial invitation sent on Feb.\n\n6 The ATP does not use routers or chains in any part of its online data collection protocol, nor are they used to direct respondents to additional\nsurveys.\n7 Postcard notifications for web panelists are sent to 1) panelists who were recruited within the last two years and 2) panelists recruited prior\nto the last two years who opt to continue receiving postcard notifications.\n\nwww.pewresearch.org\n```",

  "Data quality checks\n\nTo ensure high-quality data, Center researchers performed data quality checks to identify any respondents showing patterns of satisficing. This includes checking for whether respondents left questions blank at very high rates or always selected the first or last answer presented. As a result of this checking, two ATP respondents were removed from the survey dataset prior to weighting and analysis.\n\nWeighting\n\nThe ATP data is weighted in a process that accounts for multiple stages of sampling and nonresponse that occur at different points in the panel survey process. First, each panelist begins with a base weight that reflects their probability of recruitment into the panel. These weights are then calibrated to align with the population benchmarks in the accompanying table to correct for nonresponse to recruitment surveys and panel attrition. If only a subsample of panelists was invited to participate in the wave, this weight is adjusted to account for any differential probabilities of selection.\n\nwww.pewresearch.org\n\n\n--- Page: RE_2025.03.26_Views-of-Deportations_FINAL_page27.png ---\n27\nPEW RESEARCH CENTER",

Sampling errors and tests of statistical significance take into account the effect of weighting.\n\nAmerican Trends Panel weighting dimensions",

Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors.

  "PEW RESEARCH CENTER\n\nDonald Trump signed *several executive orders* related to immigration after becoming president on\nJan. 20. By the end of February, apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border had dropped to\n*historically low levels*, while *deportations trailed* those of the Biden administration.\n\nIn March, after the survey was conducted, *Trump used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798* to deport\n*hundreds of immigrants* that his administration said were gang members living in the country\nillegally. The rarely used act allows the government, if at war, to deport immigrants without\nallowing them to go before a judge.\n\nDuring the pandemic, migration to the U.S. stalled because governments around the world\nrestricted travel. Since 2021, U.S. Border Patrol has recorded millions of encounters with migrants\n\nwww.pewresearch.org\n\n\n--- Page: RE_2025.03.26_Views-of-Deportations_FINAL_page7.png ---\n7\nPEW RESEARCH CENTER\n\ncrossing into the U.S. from Mexico without authorization, with many seeking asylum.

  "crossing into the U.S. from Mexico without authorization, with many seeking asylum. These\nencounters peaked in 2023 and dropped sharply in 2024.1\n\nAs of 2022, an estimated 11 million immigrants lived in the U.S. without authorization. This group\nincludes those who do not have a green card or other lawful temporary residence visa or are not\nnaturalized U.S. citizens.Â² It also includes an estimated 1.2 million immigrants enrolled in\nTemporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) who are\ntemporarily protected from deportation and have a permit to work.\n\nAbout 772,000 immigrants have received temporary protection through parole programs for\nCubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans (CHNV) and Ukrainians since 2022. However,\nthe president can revoke these temporary protections. In late March, the Trump administration\nannounced it will remove this deportation protection for the approximately 532,000 CHNV\nparolees.\n\nPersonal impact of deportations, immigration enforcement\nSome U.S. adults express concern that they will be personally affected by the government's\nimmigration enforcement.",
  "Personal impact of deportations, immigration enforcement\nSome U.S. adults express concern that they will be personally affected by the government's\nimmigration enforcement.\n\n*   About one-in-five U.S. adults (19%) say they worry a lot or somewhat that they, a family\n    member or close friend could be deported.\n*   And 5% of adults say they are extremely or very worried they will be asked to prove their\n    U.S. citizenship or immigration status during their regular day-to-day activities, while\n    8% say they are somewhat worried.\n*   Notably, 42% of Hispanic adults say they are worried that they or someone close to them might\n    be deported.\n*   And 30% of immigrants say they worry that they might be asked for proof of their U.S.\n    citizenship or immigration status.",
  "Â¹ Encounters refer to events, not people, and some migrants are encountered more than once.\nÂ² The unauthorized immigrant population includes any immigrants not in the following groups: immigrants admitted for lawful residence (i.e.,\ngreen card admissions); people admitted formally as refugees; people granted asylum; former unauthorized immigrants granted legal\nresidence under the 1985 Immigration Reform and Control Act; immigrants admitted in the previously mentioned categories who have\nbecome naturalized U.S. citizens; and individuals admitted as lawful temporary residents under specific visa categories such as foreign\nstudents, guest workers, and intracompany transfers. Read the methodology section of our November 2018 report on unauthorized\nimmigrants for more details. Pew Research Center's estimate of unauthorized immigrants as of July 2022 includes more than 3 million\nimmigrants who have temporary protection from deportation and permission to be in the U.S. Some also have permission to work in the\ncountry. While these immigrants have permission to be in the U.S., they could be subject to deportation if government policy changes. In total,\nthey account for 30% of the national estimate of 11.0 million unauthorized immigrants for 2022.\n\nwww.pewresearch.org\n\n\n--- Page: RE_2025.03.26_Views-of-Deportations_FINAL_page8.png ---\n8\nPEW RESEARCH CENTER",
