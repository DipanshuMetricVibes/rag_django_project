  "--- Page: Media Effects on Consumer Behavior_page4.png ---\n4\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nOur overall objective throughout this research experiment was to determine the impact of internet communication on purchase behavior of business to business products. We looked at three particular sources of social internet-based communication. These three forms of media were blogs, Facebook, and e-mail. We also looked into whether the type of product being considered had any effect on these three forms of social communication. Our end goal was to determine what form of media would be the best outlet for our client, a business to business manager, in order to implement marketing strategies.\n\nOur research design included a questionnaire given out to 209 different individuals measuring credibility, purchase intent, and selling intent. There were 5 different forms of the questionnaire measuring either a high or low involvement product as well as a blog, Facebook, or email. It focused on questions such as what types of internet communication do consumers use when seeking out information on potential purchases. It considered what different effects the media forms had on consumers as well as what impacts it may have had on their behavior. Furthermore, it considered what characteristics caused these impacts.",
  "We created five hypotheses to measure the results of the data collected. Each hypothesis focused on a different topic of analysis. After testing these hypotheses we came to a conclusion on which source of media would be best for our client to use. Our data proved that our assumptions about the different forms of media and their effects were initially incorrect. We believed blogs would have the highest purchase intent, but emails proved to be the superior media. The insights we gained from the data collected gave us a better understanding on what best marketing strategies to use in the internet communication of B2B's industry.\n\n\n--- Page: Media Effects on Consumer Behavior_page5.png ---\n5\n\nResearch objectives – background",
  "--- Page: Media Effects on Consumer Behavior_page5.png ---\n5\n\nResearch objectives – background\n\nIn trying to determine the impact of internet communication on purchase behavior of\nB2B products, clear objectives aiding in gathering the right information are needed to help our\nclient make the best marketing decision possible. One of the main research objectives was\ndetermining what internet based communication consumers use to gain knowledge on potential\npurchases. The information gathered could be further analyzed to present our client with the\nmost successful form of communication after testing frequencies, medians, and means between\nvariances. We used three internet based communications to gather our data. Facebook, email,\nand blogs are the variables that were selected to be tested through our research design that was\ndistributed to our test market. We chose to examine and determine if there are any differences in\nthe effect that these types of communication have on purchase behavior.\nBefore developing our hypothesis, we believed that source credibility would not be the\nonly variable that will negatively or positively impact how successful different types of internet\nbased communications. Our research team believed selling intent would have an impact as well.\nWe believe that the information gathered in an attempt to answer these research questions will\nhelp the marketing manager decide on a suitable source of media for advertising.\n\nNull and alternative hypotheses",
  "Null and alternative hypotheses\n\nIn order to address our research objectives, our research group developed five\nhypotheses. Our first hypothesis attempts to determine the relationship between credibility and\npurchase intent. We believed that when someone thinks something is more credible and\ntrustworthy, then they will be more likely to buy.\n\nHA1: Source credibility will correlate positively with purchase\nHol: Source credibility will not correlate positively with purchase intent\n\n\n--- Page: Media Effects on Consumer Behavior_page6.png ---\n6\n\nOur second hypothesis aims to determine the relationship between perceived selling intent and credibility. We believed that when someone perceives that they are being sold something, they will not think it is a trustworthy source.\nHA2: Perceived selling intent will correlate negatively with credibility\nHo2: Perceived selling intent will not negatively correlate with credibility\n\nThe third alternative hypothesis explores the relationship between the degree of perceived credibility and each specific media platform. The belief is that blogs are seen as the most credible due to a heightened amount of objectivity and expertise in message creation.\nHA3: There is a relationship between perceived credibility and the type of social media platform\nHo3: There is no relationship between perceived credibility and the type of social media platform",
  "The fourth hypothesis delves into the relationship between the involvement level of products and perceived selling intent. The belief is that higher involvement products usually require more in depth interaction from the customer, therefore, the selling intent must be heightened to gauge customer interest.\nHA4: There is a significant difference in selling intent between high and low involvement\nHo4: There is no difference in selling intent between high and low involvement\n\nThe fifth hypothesis our team tested explores the media platform's relationship with purchase intent. Similar to hypothesis 3, we think that blogs will have the highest purchase intent due to the time and effort that goes into making a blog post as compared to Facebook or email.\nHA5: Blogs will have the higher purchase intent than Facebook and email\nHo5: Blogs will not have higher purchase intent than Facebook and email\n\n\n--- Page: Media Effects on Consumer Behavior_page7.png ---\n7\n\nResearch design",
  "--- Page: Media Effects on Consumer Behavior_page7.png ---\n7\n\nResearch design\n\nOur data was collected using a questionnaire format as a seven point Likert scale in order\nto collect interval data. In total 209 different individuals took a survey and the results of that\nsurvey were compiled into an overall database in which we analyzed the results to form our\nconclusions. The questionnaire asked questions determining if the consumer used the product in\nthe past, gender of the consumer, and if the product was gender neutral. Furthermore, it equally\nmeasured source credibility, purchase intent, and selling intent. Each specific topic had a total of\nfive different questions. In addition to this, questionnaires varied as to whether they measured a\nhigh involvement product or a low involvement product.",
  "The questions asked were intended to measure what types of internet based\ncommunication do consumers use to acquire information about potential purchases and if there\nare differences in the effect that these types of communication have on purchase behavior. They\nalso measured if a particular type of product affected the impact of internet communication on\npurchase behavior and specific types of internet communication. Lastly, it measured whether\nindividual characteristics affected the impact of internet communication on purchase behavior.\nThis is a casual experiment because we are controlling for extraneous factors but manipulating\nthe independent variable, which is media. It uses a true experimental design that is an \"after only\nwith no control” in which the treatment is given to a certain group. There is no testing bias\nbecause there is no before group.\n\nData errors/analysis\n\nOnce all of the data was collected properly, all 209 subjects results were stored in an\nexcel database and codes were assigned for the responses. For the 7 point Likert scale, the codes\nranged from 1 to 7 with 1 indicating strongly disagree and 7 indicating strongly agree. Codes\n\n\n--- Page: Media Effects on Consumer Behavior_page8.png ---\n8",
  "--- Page: Media Effects on Consumer Behavior_page8.png ---\n8\n\nwere assigned to the product media, message, and gender as well. As part of the first step in our\ndata analysis, our group checked the validity of the data and identified errors. We noted some\nresponses were not coded, and had text instead of numbers. We easily corrected and replaced\nthese errors, but other errors involving coding were more troublesome. For instance, there were\ntwo columns that required a coding of 1 or 2, but several responses indicated numbers greater\nthan this. We decided not use this data as part of our hypotheses since many responses are\ninaccurate.\n\nResponses to key measures",
  "Responses to key measures\n\nAs part of the next step, we added in a column for purchase intent, selling intent, and\nsource credibility into the database. We identified 5 questions that related to each topic of\ninterest so that we can compare the means as shown in Appendix A. The answers for each group\nof 5 questions were summed together in the appropriate column. When looking at some figures\nin the database, we can see that 106 males took the survey and there were 103 females. In\naddition, running a few basic averages we found that email is the source that is perceived as the\nmost credible and has the highest purchase intent. Blogs on the other hand, are perceived as\nhaving the highest selling intent. After getting a general idea of the data we were working with,\nwe used SPSS to test our hypotheses and allowed us come to sound statistical conclusions.\n\nTest of hypotheses\n\nFor our first hypothesis, we tested to see if source credibility will correlate positively\nwith purchase intent. To do so, we ran a Pearson correlation test which allowed us to look at the\nr value. Pearson's was used since we are dealing with metric, interval data. Results, in\nAppendix B, indicate a moderate, positive correlation of .546. Using an alpha level of .05, we\nknow this is a statistically significant relationship since the Sig value is less than alpha. We\n\n\n--- Page: Media Effects on Consumer Behavior_page9.png ---\n9",
  "--- Page: Media Effects on Consumer Behavior_page9.png ---\n9\n\ntherefore rejected the null hypothesis. Hypothesis 2, when tested in Appendix C, also shows the\ncorrelation between selling intent and credibility is moderate and positive at significant level\nwith an r value of .517. This means we have evidence to accept the null hypothesis. An ANOVA\nand post hoc Scheffe test were used to test hypothesis 3, as seen in Appendix D. Results indicate\nthat the mean difference for perceived credibility was higher for emails than for blogs and\nFacebook, and that the relationships were statistically significant. This means we will reject the\nnull hypothesis. Using an independent samples T-Test, hypothesis 4 was tested, as shown in\nAppendix E. The test reveals that high involvement products have higher scores for perceived\nselling intent at a significant level, giving us evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Finally,\nhypothesis 5 was tested with an ANOVA and post hoc Scheffe in Appendix F. The mean\ndifference for purchase intent was higher for emails than for Facebook and blogs at a significant\nlevel, meaning we will reject the null hypothesis.\n\nConclusion",
  "Conclusion\n\nAfter determining that email was perceived as having the highest credibility and the\nhighest purchase intent, we would recommend that management elect to use email for future\nmarketing messages. According to our statistical results, credibility correlates positively with\npurchase intent and email has the highest credibility. Therefore, it is no surprise that email had\nthe highest purchase intent. If provided with more time and resources our research group would\nalso like to delve into determining the effect that age and gender might play into the purchase\nintent of a customer who was shown information about a product on either a blog, Facebook, or\nemail. We would also be interested in determining the relationship between the type of product\n(high involvement/ low involvement) and whether a specific media platform (Facebook, Email\nand Blog) is more effective at selling products than another."
